## Issues and bug reporting
If any issues you have encountered using the demos, please report it [for atelier](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=Samhovbproject&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-for-atelier-demo.md&title=Bug+report+for+atelier+demo) and [for tetris packing](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=Samhovbproject&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-for-tetris-packing-demo.md&title=).

If you think the solver is giving incorrect solutions, please report it [for atelier](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=Samhovbproject&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-for-atelier-solver.md&title=) and [for tetris packing](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=Samhovbproject&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-for-tetris-packing-solver.md&title=).

Alternatively, if you want me to dive into a problem and create a solver, you are welcome to post it [here](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=). I will look into it.

If you want more explanation on the solver or want to point out some problems with my documentation, please also make an issue describing the problem.
