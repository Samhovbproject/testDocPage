This page is to showcase different problems and their respective solutions created by me. I am currently focusing on using SAT-solver to create efficient algorithms for different problems. This idea is heavily inspired by a solution posted on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47918792/2d-bin-packing-on-a-grid) about bin packing. I tried to modify the solution to fit a more general question of tetris packing. 

The pages will first showcase and explain the problem, then demonstrate the problem with a interactive demo, explain how to use the solver to tackle specific situation and finally give an explanation of the solver in details. Ideas and algorithms I have read and used in my solution will be included in the reference section of the problem.
