The solver is just a small modification on the original comment by sascha that can be seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47918792/2d-bin-packing-on-a-grid).

Original solution involves the materials to be used 0 to infinite times where not every materials need to be present in the solution. It also only consider a N*M board without any holes.

Holes can easily be added to the solution by removing the decision variables that represent the placement on the holes.
