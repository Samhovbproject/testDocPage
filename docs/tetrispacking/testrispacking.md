Tetris packing is a modification to the classic bin packing problem. It is about trying to pack as many pieces into a 2d space as possible, as the pieces can vary in shapes and size, it is similar to the pieces in the game Tetris. The problem seems easy at first glance but in order to know the optimal solution, all possible combination will need to be taken into consideration. 

For the demo and the solver, the grid allow holes where pieces cannot be placed on it and also pieces are allowed to rotate, flip and doesn't need to follow physical rules (e.g 3 seperate squares without linking each other).

To report bug on demo, please [create issue](https://github.com/Samhovbproject/SolverProjectGithubPage/issues/new?assignees=Samhovbproject&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-for-tetris-packing-demo.md&title=).

Currently the solver hasn't been deployed.
